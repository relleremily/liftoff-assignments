## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I wasnt to create a webpage for a daycare that will log information regarding each child.
It will include information such as what they ate, activities for the day, diaper changes
and perhaps even pictures.

I currently have a 1 and 4 year old in daycare, and each day I am provided with a sheet of paper
listing the information above. I'd like to eliminate the paper part and allow for parents to
log in and see this information.

### Features
-- User login: I will need to create logins for both the daycare teacher and the parent.
-- Create post: I want for the teacher to post on each individual page
-- Create database: this will include the logged information (sleep, food, diapers)

### Technologies
-- C#
-- MAMP


### What I'll Have to Learn
I'm not sure how to do this, but I'd like to have a chart for the children's sleep. Showing their 
average sleep times and length of sleep.
